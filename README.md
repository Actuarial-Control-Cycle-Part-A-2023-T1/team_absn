# Case Story

Storslysia has a diverse geography with various regions that are susceptible to a wide range of
climate ‚Äì related catastrophes and natural disasters. Climate change will cause the impacts of the
disaster to increase overtime and poses the constant of displacement to the residents. To mitigate
these risk and minimise financial losses due to mass displacement ASBN has been tasked to design
a social insurance program for relocation. The proposed program is divided into two parts, one for
voluntary relocation and another for involuntary relocation which will be explored below.  

# Executive Summary

ABSN Consulting has been given the task of developing a social insurance program for the 
country of Storslysia. The diverse geography of Storslysia implies that its various regions are
susceptible to distinct risks posed by severe climate-related incidents and natural disasters.
The proposed scheme aims to protect its citizens against displacement risks that may arise
due to catastrophic climate-related events and reduce the burden upon the citizens of
Storslysia in covering temporary shelter costs. Under the social insurance scheme, citizens
would be protected against displacement in the case of involuntary displacement, while
encouraging voluntary relocation in order to reduce the potential of future displacement,
particularly in areas at high risk of hazard.

In the case of involuntary displacement, houses are severely damaged as a result of climaterelated
events or natural disasters, to the point that the house becomes unliveable. In this
situation, individuals are displaced from their homes, either needing to search for alternative
accommodation or becoming homeless while their homes are rebuilt. Rebuilding a home
from scratch can take anywhere from 7 to 12 months (Heidenry 2022), and the uncertainty
without having a home during this time is detrimental upon the citizens of Storslysia, and can
negatively impact their ability to contribute to recovery efforts or the economy. Additionally,
those who are socio-economically disadvantaged experience more difficulty when recovering
from the impacts of a hazard event. As such, their need for extra help when displaced was
considered when designing this insurance scheme.

In contrast, with voluntary relocation, individuals have the freedom to move proactively from
areas at high risk of hazard event to areas of lower risk, in order to avoid future potential
displacement. By moving to a lower risk area before it is known an event will occur, potential
damage to the possessions and injury to residents is reduced, and there is no need for
individuals to spend time and money on temporary housing.

Comparing the two types of relocation above, voluntary relocation is hugely favourable from
a cost analysis perspective. However personal factors such as difficulty in moving
employment, school or selling house may play into an individual‚Äôs desire to remain in the
area they are. Therefore, while this program will be funding temporary accommodation costs
for displaced individuals, it also balances the need to encourage proactive voluntary
relocation for future sustainability.

# Objectives

The main objective of this insurance program is to incentivise residents of high-risk areas to
migrate to lower-risk regions. High risk regions were defined as regions 4-6, while the lowerrisk
regions were 1-3.

A secondary objective was to ensure that any residents of Storslysia whose house is damaged
had accommodation options in the interim while their house is rebuilt. This was the
involuntary relocation scheme and involved temporary relocation for one year.

# Program Design
The insurance scheme aims to provide coverage for involuntary displacement, while
encouraging voluntary relocation. While voluntary relocation is our preferred method of
protection, this may not be a customer‚Äôs first preference due to the high economic costs
associated with moving houses, and social cost of finding new employment and schools. In
order to encourage voluntary relocation, the program was designed to include a financial
incentive.

To be eligible for voluntary relocation, provided that our scheme commences from January
1st, 2025, Storslysia residents must
    a) Fill out an expression of interest form within the first month of scheme
        commencement, AND
    b) Currently reside in the three regions who are exposed to the greatest level of natural
        disaster risk (regions 4, 5 and 6)

In the event that a resident lodges a voluntary relocation claim, our scheme offers a lump sum
payout, which is sufficient to cover costs associated with moving as well as agent fees
associated with selling their existing house and purchasing a new one. As an additional
incentive, on top of the lump sum payout, we provide claimants the guarantee that they will
be able to relocate to a region with a lower exposure to natural disaster risk (regions 1, 2 and
3), however, region selection is restricted to claimants. Residents will be randomly allocated
to a region between 1 and 3.

For the voluntary relocation component of our insurance scheme, we look to consider new
applicants every 10 years, to ensure that costs do not exceed 10% of GDP every year. We do
expect that evaluations regarding the scheme would be needed and expect those to take place
every 10 years as well.

However, we recognise that residents may choose to remain in their current location, with
reasons including currently living in a low-risk region, or the costs associated with
purchasing a new house. Our recommended scheme also insures residents in the event of
climate-catastrophe displacement, however this scenario is less ideal for both the residents
and the government of Storslysia, as it is far more costly and has potential to be dangerous to
the lives of residents.

For a resident to be eligible for the climate-catastrophe displacement benefit, the following
requirements must be satisfied:
    a) Their property must be severely damaged by a local or regional climate event or
        natural disaster to the extent that it is unsuitable for occupation.
    b) The resident must be looking to find temporary accommodation while waiting for the
        damaged property to be repaired.

Additionally, claimants are entitled to a ‚Äòfood assistance package‚Äô following an event if they
satisfy Storslysia‚Äôs definition of being in poverty.

There is no region limitation for residents to place a claim, however they must file a claim
within a month after the natural disaster has occurred or begun. As soon as their claim has
been approved, they will be given access to temporary housing at no cost to the resident, up
to a maximum of 12 months while their original property of residence is rebuilt.

Based on the performance of the scheme in the first year, we hope to make evaluations and
yearly in following, especially the climate-catastrophe displacement section of the scheme.
This will allow us to use the first year of historical data to modify our projections and make
necessary changes to lump sum benefits if needed.

# Pricing and Risk Mitigation
According to the project design, annual project costs were projected over the 25 years starting
2025, and from 2050 onwards, estimates were taken every 10 years.

## Pricing for Involuntary Relocation
To price the involuntary/reactive relocation scheme, an expected price was used, followed by
an estimate for the 95th percentile of the cost of the program as a ‚Äúworst-case‚Äù or ‚Äúrisk‚Äù
scenario. The price for involuntary relocation was broken down into several components:

$$ Cost = \frac{Cost}{Person\ Relocated}\times\frac{People\ Relocated}{House\ Destroyed}\times\frac{Houses\ Destroyed}{Event}\timesOf\ Events\times Inflation$$

This was also determined as a percentage of the expected GDP in order to find a value that is
more easily comparable over years.

### Cost per Person Relocated
We propose that the involuntary relocation scheme pays only for the expected cost of
temporary housing for the period of one year (the average time needed to re-build a home
after a natural disaster). This cost was estimated using the temporary housing cost per person
per month given in the demographic dataset.

For people living under the poverty line, an additional allowance is provided to ensure the
claimant‚Äôs livelihood, with this allowance based off the estimated per day, per person cost of
food in the United States. The proportion of people in each region of Storslysia was provided
and assumed to be constant.

Then, the expected cost per person (ùê∂) was found to be:
ùê∏(ùê∂) = (proportion in poverty) √ó (food costs) + housing costs
![Screen Shot 2023-04-05 at 11 59 48 am](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433410/229969087-9fc95be4-7243-4a0f-a9d6-b357626bddd0.jpg)

### People Relocated per House Destroyed

This was assumed to be the number of people per household, which was given and assumed
to be constant over time.

### Houses Destroyed per Event
To calculate the number of houses destroyed per event, the following formula was used:
![338404720_143331791793545_8051804042057641537_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433410/229979622-a4e86f39-9a91-4cb8-b552-3bf84a95edb9.jpg)

The number of houses was assumed to be increasing over time. For each year, the number of
houses/hectare was calculated using the given size of each region. The number of hectares
affected by each event was assumed to be a constant based on the severity of each event, as
was the proportion of houses destroyed.
![Screen Shot 2023-04-05 at 12 00 45 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433410/229968543-bd3d1494-147e-45d4-91d1-26e220504564.jpg)

Multiplying the number of houses per hectare with the area damaged and the proportion of
destroyed houses gave a number of houses destroyed for each event severity in each region.

### Number of Events
The number of events was determined using historical data. Events were filtered by whether
they had property damages above Íùï 0. These damaged were inflation adjusted to be in terms
of 2020 dollars so that values could be fairly compared.

These events were classified into three groups: minor, medium, and major based upon being
within the 0-55%, 55%-85% and 85%-100% quantiles respectively. For each region, the
number of events was accumulated over the years, so that events were categorised by severity
(minor/medium/major) and region (1-6).

For each region and severity type, an exponential distribution was fitted using Maximum
Likelihood Estimation, which allowed the rate parameter to be estimated. This was then used
to find the expected number of events and the 95th quantile for the risk case.

These numbers were then accelerated over the years due to climate change affects using the
SSP2-3.4 index for the average case and the SSP3-6 index for the risk case.

### Inflation
To forecast future inflation rates, inflation
rates between 2000 and 2015 were used.
This was in order to avoid historical trends
(which generally do not have a huge impact
of inflation) and also avoid the impact of
COVID-19 (which would have caused a
forecast to assume sub-zero inflation far into
the future). An exponential smoothing model
was fitted in r, with multiplicative errors, an
additive but dampening trend and no
seasonality (an ùê∏ùëáùëÜ(ùëÄ, ùê¥ÙÄØó , ùëÅ) model). To
create the forecast with a degree of
randomness, the errors from the fit were
bootstrapped to create the forecast shown in
red in Figure 1.
![338626909_5588866337879754_2731671411747677023_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433410/229975075-8447959e-f41d-42fb-a764-46386a355ee8.jpg)

### GDP
The GDP of Storslysia was assumed to grow at the same rate as the worldwide GDP, which
was given as a forecast every 10 years. The growth rate was calculated and multiplied by the
2020 GDP.

### Accumulating Costs over Regions
Given all the factors that contributed to the cost calculation, the number of relocations per
region per year was found and multiplied by the cost of relocation for each person. This was
accumulated across regions to be a national cost for the country and adjusted for inflation.

## Pricing for Voluntary Relocation
Every ten years, when a relocation period occurs, the cost per region is calculated as the
formula:
ùê∂ùëúùë†ùë°ÙÄØèÙÄØ¢ÙÄØüÙÄØ®ÙÄØ°ÙÄØßÙÄØîÙÄØ•ÙÄØ¨ = ùëõÙÄØãÙÄØòÙÄØüÙÄØ¢ÙÄØñÙÄØîÙÄØßÙÄØúÙÄØ° √ó benefit amount
The benefit amount was region-dependent, with a lump sum equivalent to half of the perperson
cost calculated previously for temporary housing. This was approximately Íùï 10,000
per person, chosen to ensure that voluntary relocation was cheaper on a per-person basis to
the government than involuntary relocation.

### Number of People Relocating
To find the number of people relocating each year, we projected the population, assuming
that the population of Storslysia was increasing at the same rate as the global population. We
also assumed that in the first relocation period (2025), 5% of the populations of regions 4-6
would choose to relocate, and a further 1% of the population of these regions would choose
to relocate in each subsequent relocation period.

# Results

The expected program costs in millions of Íùï and this cost as a percentage of the GDP is
shown below. The full results (annual projections until 2050 and projections every 10 years
thereafter) can be found in Appendix B.

![Screen Shot 2023-04-05 at 12 01 29 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433410/229972678-d68f1112-5bb9-4008-af79-89c7366de715.jpg)

These results are also graphically shown below in Figures 2 and 3, with Figure 2 showing the
accumulated costs as nominal amounts while Figure Y shows these costs as a percentage of
GDP. These figures span for the proposed lifetime of the program, with obvious revaluations
needed periodically.

![Screen Shot 2023-04-05 at 12 01 51 pm 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433410/229972935-ea55cf4a-e26e-418e-ae9c-a6d59abcc907.jpg)

From Figure 2, we can see that the cost of the program is increasing over time, but the
cost/GDP is decreasing over time (Figure 3). This indicated that the GDP is increasing faster
than the costs, which is an assumption based on the growth of global GDP. Storslysia started
with a very low GDP of Íùï71.66 per capita in 2020. This GDP is very low, and thus for the
first few years, the program cost is larger than the GDP. As the GDP grows, the relative
impact of the costs decreases, and the program becomes more affordable. In the initial years,
there will need to be a lot of continual monitoring in order to ensure that the government is
being sustainable in their sources of funding and the program remains affordable. In 2036, in
the risk case, the program costs less than 10% of Storslysia‚Äôs GDP (9.07%). In the average or
expected case, this occurs in 2031 (9.8%).

The risk case for cost projections is consistently higher than the average case, as expected.
Interestingly, the gap between the risk case and the average case is increasing over time,
which indicates that the rate of increase of the cost in the risk case is higher than that of the
average case. This is largely due to the difference in SSP index chosen, as SSP3-6 has much
larger amplification factors for events, so over time there are a lot more events in the risk
case.

Under the proposed social insurance scheme, the costs are lower for the government, as
without voluntary relocation, more people will need to be involuntarily relocated to other
places in the event of a disaster. The cost of voluntary relocation is half of the cost of
involuntary relocation, and thus voluntary relocation is the favourable outcome. Further
analysis could determine how many people who voluntarily relocate will be involuntarily
relocated as well, as this will be more of an indicator of whether or not the government is
wasting money by incentivising relocation only to then pay out temporary housing claims
from the same individuals.

# Risk Considerations

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1 ‚Äì Changes in Climate
ÔÇ∑ Changes in climate are often unpredictable, even with current predictive technology,
and depending on the frequency and intensity of natural disasters it could drastically
impact the program.
ÔÇ∑ The model is based on the severity of the event which has classifications as minor,
medium and major but depending on the climate different event may change in
classification and render the model ineffective.
Mitigation: The disaster severity model should be re-evaluated yearly, incorporating
historical climate-catastrophe data, and ensuring it is still relevant. The prediction of future
events should also be re-formulated yearly to confirm the fund level is still at a surplus.

### Risk 2 ‚Äì Economic Shocks
ÔÇ∑ Sudden changes to interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates as well as any other
unforeseen changes in the economy could severely impact our pricing scheme.
ÔÇ∑ Catastrophic events such as COVID-19, may impact the economy and stunt
population growth, hence making our model redundant.
Mitigation: Constant monitoring of relevant economic variables to ensure that any changes
are inputted immediately. Revaluating the funds surplus level frequently to incorporate the
economic changes will be required to ensure that sufficient funds are available to sustain the
scheme.

### Risk 3 ‚Äì Accessibility to work following relocation
ÔÇ∑ While we provide incentives for residents living in high-risk regions to move to lowrisk
regions, accessibility to current work may decrease.
ÔÇ∑ This may in turn, decrease the appeal to voluntarily relocate.
Mitigation: Considering feedback from residents, in particular those who choose to opt out of
the voluntary relocation scheme, the payout may be increased to include an unemployment
benefit for a period of time.

### Risk 4 ‚Äì Holding of Assumptions
ÔÇ∑ Most of our insurance scheme model is highly reliant on several assumptions we have
made, listed further in the report
Mitigation: Review the assumptions and model yearly, to ensure that appropriate assumptions
still hold, and modifying assumptions that no longer hold.

### Other Risks
ÔÇ∑ Large events that may cause sudden increases in the number of claims ‚Äì Storslysian
government will need to account for the funding in this scenario
ÔÇ∑ Implementation risk ‚Äì the risk that there is some issue with the implementation of the
insurance program

## Severity Ranking for Risks
The four main risks were ranked in order of severity, starting from 1, being the least
impactful, Minor, followed by 2, Minor, 3, Major and 4, Catastrophic. This was followed by
assessing the probability of each risk occurring. After consideration, we ranked our main
risks in order of riskiness as follows: Risk 1, 2, 3, and 4. Diagrammatically, the top right of
the matrix displays the highest risks, while the bottom left displays the lowest in risk. The full
matrix can be seen below in Figure 4.

![338174341_1870541679998753_6540041881972548009_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433410/229975251-d42a3fa4-593f-4bb0-a5b4-066ccb5fd65e.jpg)

## Costs with and without the program

This program in Storslysia is the first program
of the sort by the Storslysian government.
Thus, the cost to the government before this
program should have been 0, as previously
there were no similar programs and residents
paid for their own home and contents
insurance. If we simply compare the past
property damage values with the future
projected costs, we can see that property
damage per year is usually only a few million,
sometimes reaching a billion. However, the
projected program costs are over 1 billion
every year, so this program may be a bit more
expensive than the previous program. The past
property damage is visible in Figure 5 below.

![338830327_214214061215786_6072662416248683933_n](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113433410/229975394-5fc64962-4515-4cd1-b2b1-8fc3ff7d5a62.jpg)

## 10% of GDP requirement
Under the risk case, we studied the 95th percentile of any distributions used, and moved from
using SSP2-3.4 to SSP3-6. This then created the ‚Äúrisk case‚Äù outlined above. In this case, costs
will be below 10% of GDP after 2035, and until then the government may need to consider
some alternative sources of funding.

# Assumptions
ÔÇ∑ Historical Property Damage Quantiles
o Assumed quantiles of 0%-55%, 55%-85% and 85%-100% to classify impacts
of a natural disaster as minor, medium and major, respectively.
o These levels were tested and chosen as they provided the most feasible
number of events under each disaster classification
ÔÇ∑ Future Property Damage Index
o For future property damage, a disaster severity index was developed, which
classifies the impacts of a natural disaster as either minor, medium, or major
based on the damage caused per hectare
o Assumed values of 300, 3000 and 30000 hectares for a minor, medium, and
major event respectively
o A similar disaster classification system has been used by Gad-el-Hak (2009),
which classified disasters based on their geographical area impact.
o It was also assumed that a constant proportion of affected houses would be left
inhabitable from damage.
ÔÇ∑ Home and Contents Insurance
o Assumed that all residents in Storslysia have home & contents insurance and
hence in the event of a climate-catastrophe, they are covered for the rebuilding
and repairing of their property.
o Current costs provided by our scheme only cover temporary relocation costs
or associated moving costs.

Housing units growth rate
o Calculated that the housing units growth rate from 2021-2022 by assuming all
building permits in 2021 was completed in 2022 and made up the total new
housing units 2022.
o The growth rate from 2021-2022 was taken as a constant for the future years
ÔÇ∑ Number of people per household
o Assumed that the given number of people per household for each region
remained constant over time
ÔÇ∑ Growth rate
o For the following metrics: population, worldwide GDP and SSP, 150 years
forecast was given in 10-year increments
o It was assumed that the growth rate is constant within the 10-year increments.
The calculation is as follows: 1 + ùëî = ÙÅâÄ
ÙÄØÄÙÄÆΩÙÄØâÙÄ∞ÆÙÄ∞¨ÙÄ∞ØÙÄ∞¨
ÙÄØÄÙÄÆΩÙÄØâÙÄ∞ÆÙÄ∞¨ÙÄ∞ÆÙÄ∞¨
ÙÅâÅ
ÙÄ¨¥.ÙÄ¨µ
o Note: Storslysia‚Äôs GDP is assumed to follow the worldwide GDP growth rate
ÔÇ∑ Storslysia follows similar trends to the United States
o Assumed that food costs used in the ‚Äòfood assistance package‚Äô of our scheme
follow the same average costs (per day and per person) as those of the US.
ÔÇ∑ Claims filing and processing costs
o It was assumed that there were no costs of filing and/or processing claims
(claims would be made, verified, and distributed with negligible costs)

Percentage of people in poverty is constant over time
ÔÇ∑ SSP2-3.4 and SSP3-6
o Storslysia follows the SSP2-3.4 index in the normal scenario as this scenario
follows historical trends.

The risk case follows SSP3-6 as this is the case in which emissions of
greenhouse gasses are not reduced

# Data and Data Limitations

The existing data presented difficulties in designing and cost projecting the social insurance
scheme. Central to this were two main challenges: lack of historical displacement data, and
insufficient time series data for various economic and demographic statistics.
While the given datasets included a historical record of natural disasters across Storslysia,
and their respective amounts of property damage, injuries, and fatalities, these do not
translate directly into a ‚Äònumber of people displaced‚Äô figure, that is instrumental in helping to
project costs and plan an insurance scheme designed to give housing to those displaced after
a natural disaster. As such, these values had to be provided within the Assumptions section of
this report, and are not necessarily accurate nor valid, and introducing further areas of error
within cost projections.

Secondly, within the economic and demographic dataset of the brief, many data items only
include an entry for a single year, and no further historical data. This can present as two
different problems, the first being that with only a single datapoint, it is impossible to
determine whether or not the statistic deviates significantly over time, for example, poverty
rates and house prices. The second is that it is then also difficult to know how these statistics
will behave in the future, and whether they are increasing or decreasing. Generating values
for these statistics for future years is necessary in order to project the costs of the insurance
scheme, however, is difficult and leaves large margin for error. When projecting the GDP and
population of Storslysia into the future based off only a few datapoints, the assumption was
made that these values followed the same growth rates as the world‚Äôs GDP and population.
However, this inherently is a flawed assumption that is unlikely to be true for Storslysia,
however due to the limited data available, it would be impossible to project these statistics
into the future based on the few datapoints given. As such, the projections may deviate from
what the true future experience of Storslysia.

Additionally, there are cases where data for Storslysia is not present and must be substituted
with data obtained from the US. These two countries are not a one-for-one comparison, and
as such when using the daily food cost of a person in the US in finding the value of the food
assistance package for the scheme, it is possible that the value used has been too conservative
or too aggressive. There were also numerous areas in the provided data, such as in inflation
figures where certain values were missing or were at an unreasonable level, for example, an
approximately -900% inflation. In this instance, the value was replaced with the average of
the year before and year after, impacting the possible accuracy of inflation projections and
inflation adjusted historical figures.
Th quality of this report‚Äôs projections, and its understanding of Storslysia‚Äôs climate is limited
to what can be gained by the data that has been provided. While insufficient data does not
make the implementation of a displacement related social insurance scheme impossible, after
its implementation, thorough and frequent reviews of the effectiveness, costs and direction of
the scheme will need to be implemented to ensure that analysis have been correctly
conducted and that costs will not be extreme.
